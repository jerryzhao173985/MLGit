## How to Use

1. Navigate to any repository and tap on a file
2. The app will automatically detect the file type and use the appropriate viewer
3. Use the toolbar buttons to:
   - Toggle line numbers
   - Change syntax highlighting theme
   - Search within the file
   - Adjust font size

## Technical Details

- **Entry Point**: `OptimizedFileDetailView` in `/MLGit/Features/FileBrowser/OptimizedFileDetailView.swift`
- **Chunk Manager**: `FileContentChunkManager` handles progressive loading
- **Type Detection**: `FileTypeDetector` identifies 70+ file types
- **Specialized Viewers**:
  - `ChunkedCodeView` - For source code with syntax highlighting
  - `OptimizedMarkdownView` - For markdown files
  - `ImageFileView` - For images
  - `JSONFileView` - For JSON files
  - `PlainTextView` - Fallback for plain text

## Testing

1. Open the app and navigate to any repository
2. Try viewing different file types:
   - Large source code files (should load progressively)
   - Markdown files (should render with formatting)
   - JSON files (should show pretty-printed structure)
   - Images (should display with zoom)
3. Test features:
   - Toggle line numbers
   - Change themes
   - Search for text
   - Scroll through large files

## Notes

- The previous `EnhancedFileDetailView` is no longer used
- All file viewing now goes through `OptimizedFileDetailView`
- User preferences (theme, line numbers, etc.) are not yet persisted between sessions (this is the remaining todo item)

## Build Status

✅ **BUILD SUCCEEDED** - All compilation errors have been resolved.
