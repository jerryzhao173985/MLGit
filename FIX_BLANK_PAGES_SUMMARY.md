# Fix for Blank Page Issues - Summary

## Problem Fixed

Files like `.gitignore` and `*.py` were showing blank white pages even though:
- Content was being fetched successfully (logs showed "Successfully fetched data")
- FileDetailViewModel showed `hasContent=true` 
- Theme options were visible but no content displayed

## Root Cause

The issue was a chain of problems:

1. **UTF-8 Decoding Failure**: When files contained non-UTF-8 characters, `String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)` returned nil
2. **Empty String Default**: The nil was converted to an empty string: `?? ""`
3. **Incorrect Binary Detection**: Files were marked as binary when `content.isEmpty && data.count > 0`
4. **Blank Display**: Views received empty content strings and displayed blank pages

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. GitService.swift - Multiple Encoding Support

```swift
// Try multiple encodings before giving up
let encodings: [(String.Encoding, String)] = [
    (.utf8, "UTF-8"),
    (.utf16, "UTF-16"),
    (.isoLatin1, "ISO-8859-1"),
    (.windowsCP1252, "Windows-1252"),
    (.ascii, "ASCII")
    // ... and more
]

// Proper binary detection based on content analysis
private func isLikelyBinary(data: Data) -> Bool {
    // Check for null bytes and control characters
    // Not based on encoding success/failure
}
```

### 2. FileTypeDetector.swift - Raw Data Support

```swift
// Now accepts raw data for accurate detection
static func detectType(from filePath: String, content: String? = nil, data: Data? = nil) -> FileType
```

### 3. OptimizedFileDetailView.swift - Encoding Issue Handling

```swift
// Check if encoding failed
if content.content.isEmpty && !content.isBinary && content.size > 0 {
    // Show encoding issue view with helpful message
    EncodingIssueView(fileContent: content, fontSize: fontSize)
}
```

## What Users Will See Now

### For Text Files with Standard Encoding
- Content displays normally with syntax highlighting
- All themes work as expected

### For Text Files with Non-Standard Encoding
- Content displays using the best available encoding
- Encoding used is logged for debugging
- Falls back to ASCII with lossy conversion if needed

### For Files with Encoding Failures
- Clear message explaining the encoding issue
- Shows file size and attempted encoding
- Suggests possible causes

### For Binary Files
- Correctly identified and shows "Binary File" message
- No more false positives

## Testing

The fix handles:
- ✅ Standard UTF-8 files (.gitignore, .py, etc.)
- ✅ Files with Windows-1252 or Latin-1 encoding
- ✅ Files with mixed or unknown encodings
- ✅ Actual binary files
- ✅ Large files with encoding issues

## Build Status

✅ **BUILD SUCCEEDED** - All changes compile without errors.

## How It Works Now

1. Fetch file data
2. Check if likely binary using content analysis (not encoding success)
3. If text file, try multiple encodings in order
4. If all fail, use lossy ASCII conversion
5. Display content or show encoding issue message
6. Never show blank pages for files with content
