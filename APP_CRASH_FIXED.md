# App Crash When Viewing Files - FIXED

## Root Cause

The app was **crashing** (Signal 9 termination) when trying to display large files. The logs showed:
- Files loaded successfully (README.md with 30,168 characters)
- But then: "XPC connection interrupted" and "Terminated due to signal 9"

This is a **memory/performance issue** caused by:

1. **PlainCodeView** in EnhancedFileDetailView using `ForEach` to create a view for each line
2. Large files (like README.md) have thousands of lines
3. Creating thousands of views at once causes iOS to kill the app

## Solution

Created **SafeFileDetailView** which:
1. Uses a single `Text` view instead of `ForEach`
2. Limits display to first 500 lines for large files
3. Shows file statistics (character count, line count)
4. Prevents memory exhaustion

## Changes Made

### 1. Created SafeFileDetailView.swift
- Safe rendering for large files
- Single Text view approach
- Line limiting with user notification

### 2. Created SimpleFileView.swift
- Ultra-simple test view
- Shows only first 1000 characters
- For debugging purposes

### 3. Updated CodeView.swift
- Changed navigation from `EnhancedFileDetailView` to `SafeFileDetailView`
- This is the primary fix that prevents crashes

## Testing

### Option 1: Use the Safe View (Recommended)
1. Navigate to any repository
2. Go to Code tab
3. Open any file - it should display without crashing

### Option 2: Use Test Views
1. Go to Debug tab
2. Try "Test Enhanced File View (README)" - now uses SimpleFileView
3. Should show file preview without crashing

## Why It Was Crashing

```swift
// BAD - Creates thousands of views
ForEach(Array(lines.enumerated()), id: \.offset) { index, line in
    HStack {
        Text(lineNumber)
        Text(line)
    }
}

// GOOD - Single Text view
Text(content)
    .font(.system(size: fontSize, design: .monospaced))
```

## Performance Considerations

For files with:
- < 500 lines: Display all content
- > 500 lines: Display first 500 lines with notification
- Binary files: Show file info only

## Console Messages

You should now see:
```
FileDetailViewModel: Loaded file - size: 30168, isBinary: false, contentLength: 30168
// No more crashes!
```

## Next Steps

1. Consider implementing:
   - Lazy loading for large files
   - Pagination or virtualization
   - Streaming content display

2. Update remaining views:
   - Replace all uses of EnhancedFileDetailView
   - Remove the problematic ForEach pattern

3. Add file size warnings:
   - Warn before opening very large files
   - Offer options (preview, download, etc.)

## Emergency Fallback

If still crashing, use the **SimpleFileView** which only shows first 1000 characters as a preview.
