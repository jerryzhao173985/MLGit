# Enhanced Views Testing Guide

## What's Been Fixed

### 1. **Enhanced Diff View** (`EnhancedDiffView.swift`)
- ✅ Proper git patch parsing with headers, stats, and hunks
- ✅ Color-coded additions (green) and deletions (red)
- ✅ Displays commit metadata (author, date, subject)
- ✅ Shows file statistics (additions/deletions)
- ✅ Line numbers and context

### 2. **Enhanced File Detail View** (`EnhancedFileDetailView.swift`)
- ✅ Syntax highlighting for 185+ languages using Highlightr
- ✅ Multiple theme support (GitHub, Xcode, VS Code Dark, etc.)
- ✅ Binary file detection and proper display
- ✅ Font size control and line wrapping options
- ✅ Line numbers toggle

### 3. **Markdown Rendering** (`MarkdownView.swift`)
- ✅ Native markdown parsing for common elements
- ✅ Supports headers, bold/italic, code blocks, lists, tables
- ✅ Styled rendering with proper typography

## How to Test

### Method 1: Debug Tab (Recommended)
1. Build and run the app in DEBUG mode
2. Navigate to the "Debug" tab at the bottom (ladybug icon)
3. Test the following:
   - **Test Diff View**: Uses your provided commit `cd167baf693b155805622e340008388cc89f61b2`
   - **Test File View (README)**: Shows enhanced markdown rendering
   - **Test File View (Code)**: Shows syntax highlighting
   - **Test Sample Content**: Shows sample markdown and patch rendering

### Method 2: Normal App Flow
1. Navigate to any repository in the Explore tab
2. Go to "Commits" section
3. Tap on any commit
4. Tap "View Diff" to see the enhanced diff view
5. Navigate to "Code" section and tap any file to see enhanced file view

## Key Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Persistent repository storage (7-day cache)
- ✅ Fixed multiple view initializations
- ✅ Lazy loading for better responsiveness
- ✅ Different cache expiration times for different content types
- ✅ Offline support

### Visual Enhancements
- ✅ Proper diff visualization matching git standards
- ✅ Syntax highlighting with theme support
- ✅ Better file type detection
- ✅ Improved error handling

## Troubleshooting

If you still see issues:

1. **Enable Debug Logging**:
   - Go to Settings → Developer Settings
   - Enable "Debug Mode"
   - Check console for detailed logs

2. **Clear Cache**:
   - Settings → Clear Cache
   - Force refresh by pull-to-refresh in lists

3. **Check Network**:
   - Ensure cgit server is accessible
   - Check for any proxy/firewall issues

## Next Steps

To add full markdown support:
```bash
# In Xcode:
1. Select project → Package Dependencies
2. Click "+" 
3. Add: https://github.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui
4. Select version and add to target
```

The enhanced views are now integrated throughout the app and should resolve the visualization issues you were experiencing.
