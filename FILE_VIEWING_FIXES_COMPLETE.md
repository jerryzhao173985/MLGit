# File Viewing Fixes Complete

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. PNG/Image Files Showing as Text
- **Issue**: PNG files were being decoded as ISO-8859-1 text instead of being detected as binary
- **Fix**: Added binary file signature detection in GitService.swift for common image formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, PDF)
- **Fix**: Modified GitService to return base64-encoded content for binary files
- **Fix**: Added ImageFileView support to EnhancedFileDetailView

### 2. .gitignore Files Showing Blank
- **Issue**: Files without extensions like .gitignore weren't being properly detected for syntax highlighting
- **Fix**: Updated detectLanguage function to handle special files without extensions
- **Fix**: Added support for .gitignore, .gitmodules, .gitconfig, Dockerfile, Makefile, etc.

### 3. Empty Content Handling
- **Issue**: Files with encoding issues would show blank pages
- **Fix**: Added defensive checks for empty content with non-zero file size
- **Fix**: Added proper error messages for encoding issues vs genuinely empty files

### 4. EnhancedFileDetailView Updates
- **Fix**: Replaced temporary debug view with proper OptimizedCodeView for code files
- **Fix**: Added proper file type detection and routing to appropriate viewers
- **Fix**: Added debug logging to help diagnose issues

## Files Modified

1. `/MLGit/Core/Services/GitService.swift`
   - Added binary file signature detection
   - Modified to return base64 encoding for binary files
   - Improved binary detection logic

2. `/MLGit/Features/FileBrowser/EnhancedFileDetailView.swift`
   - Added ImageFileView support for image files
   - Added detectLanguage function with support for special files
   - Replaced temporary debug view with OptimizedCodeView
   - Added defensive checks for empty content
   - Added debug logging

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with .gitignore files - should now show with proper syntax highlighting
2. Test with PNG/JPEG files - should display as images, not garbled text
3. Test with Python files - should show with Python syntax highlighting
4. Test with files that have encoding issues - should show appropriate error message
5. Test with genuinely empty files - should show "Empty File" message

## Known Limitations

- The app uses EnhancedFileDetailView instead of OptimizedFileDetailView
- Binary detection relies on file signatures and content analysis
- Some exotic text encodings may still fail to decode properly
