# Blank File Display Issue - FIXED

## Root Cause
The issue was that **OptimizedFileDetailView** was being used (not EnhancedFileDetailView), and when Highlightr couldn't highlight certain languages (like "gitignore"), it would return nil and fall back to PlainCodeTextView, which had layout issues causing blank display.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. OptimizedCodeView Layout Fixes
- Added proper frame modifiers to ensure content fills available space
- Added debug logging to track content flow
- Added emergency fallback view for when all else fails

### 2. Language Mapping for Highlightr
- Created `mapLanguageForHighlightr()` function to map unsupported languages:
  - "gitignore" → "bash" (similar syntax)
  - "gitconfig" → "ini"
  - "dockerfile" → "dockerfile"
  - etc.
- This ensures Highlightr can highlight files it previously couldn't

### 3. Binary Detection Improvements
- Added NumPy .npy file signature detection
- Added file extension-based binary detection for common binary formats
- Files like .npy, .npz, .pkl, .model, .h5, .tflite, .pb are now properly detected as binary

### 4. PlainCodeTextView Improvements
- Added empty lines check with fallback message
- Improved line splitting logic for single-line files without newlines
- Added proper frame alignment

### 5. Emergency Fallback
- Added a simple Text view that displays raw content if all else fails
- Shows a yellow "Emergency Fallback View" indicator when active

## Files Modified

1. `/MLGit/Features/FileBrowser/OptimizedCodeView.swift`
   - Fixed layout issues
   - Added language mapping
   - Improved line splitting
   - Added emergency fallback

2. `/MLGit/Core/Services/GitService.swift`
   - Added NumPy file signature detection
   - Added extension-based binary detection

## Testing Checklist

✓ .gitignore files should now display with bash-like syntax highlighting
✓ Python files should display with Python syntax highlighting
✓ NumPy .npy files should be detected as binary
✓ PNG/JPEG files should be displayed as images
✓ Empty files should show "No content to display"
✓ Files with encoding issues should use the emergency fallback

## Debug Output
The fixes include extensive debug logging:
- Content length and line count
- Language detection and mapping
- Highlighting success/failure
- PlainCodeTextView rendering status
